        <p>2 years ago I found myself in a bad place. I had worked in a fintech startup as a customer support for 4 years, and while I adored the people, any meaningful career change within the company never happened. I had side projects, sure, but at the end of the day my worth was still calculated very plainly by the amount of calls and e-mails I handled per day. While wholesome coworkers can keep you going, deep down where it really matters, it can be... well, quite soul crushing ðŸ˜‘</p>

        <p>As the bootcamp went to the backend part, I lost the willingness to follow through since Colt used a cloud-based IDE which no longer is live, and getting the out-dated code to work via alternative means was just too much of a hurdle for a newbie like me to chew through (2021 disclaimer: the course has now been updated!). At this point my artsy craftsy side kicked in as well, and I just wanted to continue experimenting with the "fun bits". I kept following Youtube code-alongs for more advanced CSS, for example I very much recommend this one that finally helped me build my first portfolio.</p>
